Personalization: Wanderlog is generic; you can make it context-aware (weather, season, interests).
Cultural depth: Add etiquette, language tips, and festival integration.
AI-driven optimization: Real-time itinerary adjustments and smart suggestions.
Offline usability: Wanderlog relies heavily on connectivity.
