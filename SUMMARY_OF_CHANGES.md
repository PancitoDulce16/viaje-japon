# 📝 Summary of Changes - Improved Itinerary System

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Users had to manually add cities one by one, with only ONE city per day. The system didn't allow:
- ❌ Short visits to multiple cities in a day
- ❌ Flexible time ranges for city visits
- ❌ Different cities within the same day

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Created a **flexible city assignment system** that allows:
- ✅ Multiple cities per day
- ✅ Optional time ranges for each city visit (start/end times)
- ✅ Full-day visits (when no times specified)
- ✅ Short visits (when times are specified)
- ✅ Easy add/remove of city blocks

## 📦 What Was Changed

### 1. **UI Improvements (Step 2 of Wizard)**

**Before**:
```
Day 1: [Dropdown: Select one city]
```

**After**:
```
Day 1:
  [+ Add City Button]
  
  City Blocks:
  ┌─────────────────────────┐
  │ City: [Tokyo ▼]         │
  │ Start: [09:00]          │
  │ End:   [13:00]          │
  │                    [🗑️] │
  └─────────────────────────┘
  ┌─────────────────────────┐
  │ City: [Yokohama ▼]      │
  │ Start: [15:00]          │
  │ End:   [20:00]          │
  │                    [🗑️] │
  └─────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Data Structure Update**

**Old Structure**:
```javascript
cityDayAssignments: [
  {
    cityId: "tokyo",
    dayStart: 1,
    dayEnd: 3,
    type: "multi-day"
  }
]
```

**New Structure**:
```javascript
cityDayAssignments: [
  {
    day: 1,
    date: "2026-02-16",
    cities: [
      {
        cityId: "tokyo",
        cityName: "Tokyo",
        timeStart: "09:00",
        timeEnd: "13:00",
        isFullDay: false,
        order: 1
      },
      {
        cityId: "yokohama",
        cityName: "Yokohama",
        timeStart: "15:00",
        timeEnd: "20:00",
        isFullDay: false,
        order: 2
      }
    ],
    cityCount: 2,
    isMultiCity: true
  }
]
```

### 3. **New Functions Added**

In `js/itinerary-builder.js`:
- `addCityBlock(dayNumber, dateStr)` - Adds a new city block to a day
- `removeCityBlock(blockId, dayNumber)` - Removes a city block
- `updateCityCount(dayNumber)` - Updates the city counter display
- `calculateActivityTime(startTime, activityIndex)` - Calculates activity times based on city time ranges

### 4. **Updated Functions**

- `generateDateCitySelector()` - Now generates flexible day containers
- `validateCurrentStep()` - Validates that each day has at least one city
- `getCityDayAssignments()` - Collects city blocks for each day
- `generateActivitiesFromTemplate()` - Distributes activities across multiple cities intelligently

### 5. **Display Improvements**

In `js/itinerary.js`, the day overview now shows:
- All cities visited in a day
- Time ranges for each city visit
- "Full day" indicator when no times specified
- Multi-city visual distinction

Example display:
```
🗺️ Cities of the day:
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tokyo                            │
│ 🕐 09:00 - 13:00                 │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Yokohama                         │
│ 🕐 15:00 - 20:00                 │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```
