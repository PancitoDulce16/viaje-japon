# ü§ñ AI Integration - Japan Trip Planner

## Overview

This project now includes **intelligent AI-powered recommendations** using OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide personalized itinerary suggestions for your Japan trip.

## Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Itinerary Generation**
When creating a new itinerary through the wizard, the AI automatically:
- Generates personalized activities based on your interests
- Suggests optimal timing for each activity
- Recommends transportation options
- Provides budget estimates
- Considers travel pace (relaxed, moderate, intense)

### 2. **Intelligent Recommendations**
The AI provides:
- **Day-by-day itinerary** with specific activities
- **Travel tips** specific to your preferences
- **Hidden gems** that match your interests
- **Budget breakdowns** in Japanese Yen
- **Transportation advice** including JR Pass usage
- **Station-specific** metro/train information

### 3. **Itinerary Analysis**
For existing itineraries, the AI can:
- Analyze your current itinerary
- Identify strengths and areas for improvement
- Suggest hidden gems and alternative activities
- Provide day-specific optimization tips
- Recommend better activity sequencing

### 4. **Personalization**
The AI considers:
- **Your interests** (temples, food, shopping, nature, culture, etc.)
- **Travel style** (relaxed, moderate, intense)
- **Cities you're visiting** (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, etc.)
- **Trip duration** (number of days)
- **Budget preferences**
- **Special requests**

## How to Use

### Creating a New AI-Powered Itinerary

1. **Navigate to the Itinerary tab**
2. **Click "‚ú® Crear Itinerario"**
3. **Follow the wizard**:
   - Step 1: Enter trip name and dates
   - Step 2: Select cities and assign days
   - Step 3: (Optional) Add flight information
   - Step 4: Select your interests
   - Step 5: Choose a template or start from scratch
4. **Click "‚ú® Crear Itinerario"**
5. **The AI will generate** personalized activities automatically
6. **View AI Insights** modal showing tips and recommendations

### Getting AI Recommendations for Existing Itinerary

1. **Open your itinerary**
2. **Click the "ü§ñ Sugerencias AI" button** (purple/pink gradient button)
3. **Wait for AI analysis** (usually takes 5-10 seconds)
4. **Review the comprehensive analysis** including:
   - Overall analysis
   - Strengths of your itinerary
   - Suggested improvements
   - Hidden gems to add
   - Optimization tips

### AI-Generated Activities Include

Each activity has:
- **Title** and detailed description
- **Optimal time** to visit
- **Duration** estimate
- **Location** with nearest station
- **Cost** in Japanese Yen
- **Category** (temple, food, shopping, etc.)
- **AI Reasoning** - why this activity fits your preferences

## API Configuration

The AI integration uses OpenAI's API. **You need to set your API key before using AI features.**

### Setting Your API Key

Open the browser console and run:

```javascript
// Set your OpenAI API key (one time setup)
localStorage.setItem('openai_api_key', 'your-actual-api-key-here');
```

The key will be stored in your browser and used for AI features.

**Configuration in code:**
```javascript
// In js/ai-integration.js
get apiKey() {
  return localStorage.getItem('openai_api_key') || '';
}
model: 'gpt-4o-mini' // Cost-effective GPT-4 variant
```

### Security Note ‚ö†Ô∏è

**IMPORTANT**: The API key is stored in localStorage (browser storage). For production use, you should:

1. **Move the API key to a backend service**
2. **Create a proxy API** that calls OpenAI from your server
3. **Never expose API keys** in client-side code
4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data

### Recommended Production Setup

```
Client ‚Üí Your Backend API ‚Üí OpenAI API
```

This prevents:
- API key exposure
- Direct billing charges from malicious use
- Rate limiting issues
- CORS problems

### How AI Generation Works

```
1. User selects preferences (cities, interests, travel style)
   ‚Üì
2. System builds context from activities database
   ‚Üì
3. AI prompt is constructed with:
   - User preferences
   - Available activities in selected cities
   - Trip duration and pace
   - Budget preferences
   ‚Üì
4. OpenAI API call with structured prompt
   ‚Üì
5. AI generates JSON response with:
   - Day-by-day activities
   - Travel tips
   - Budget summary
   - Transportation advice
   ‚Üì
6. Response is parsed and integrated into itinerary
   ‚Üì
7. Activities are saved to Firebase
   ‚Üì
8. AI Insights modal is displayed
```

### Fallback Mechanism

The system includes a robust fallback:

```
1. Attempt AI generation
   ‚Üì
2. If AI fails ‚Üí Use template-based generation
   ‚Üì
3. Activities are still created based on:
   - Selected template
   - User categories
   - Activities database
   - City preferences
```

This ensures your itinerary is always created, even if AI is unavailable.

## Cost Estimation

Using GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective):
- **~$0.01-0.03 per itinerary generation** (7-14 days)
- **~$0.005-0.01 per analysis request**
- **Very affordable** for personal use

Total estimated cost: **~$0.50-1.00 per month** for moderate usage.

## Testing the Integration

### Test AI Connection

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
await AIIntegration.testConnection();
// Should return: true and log "Hello! AI is connected."
```

### Test Itinerary Generation

```javascript
const result = await AIIntegration.generateItineraryRecommendations({
  cities: ['tokyo', 'kyoto'],
  interests: ['temples', 'food', 'culture'],
  days: 7,
  travelStyle: 'moderate'
});
console.log(result);
```

### Test Itinerary Analysis

```javascript
const analysis = await AIIntegration.getPersonalizedSuggestions(
  window.ItineraryHandler.currentItinerary,
  ['temples', 'food']
);
console.log(analysis);
```

## Prompt Engineering

The AI prompts are carefully crafted to:

1. **Be specific** about Japan travel context
2. **Request structured JSON** responses
3. **Include practical details** (stations, costs, timing)
4. **Consider cultural appropriateness**
5. **Optimize for real-world usability**

Example prompt structure:
```
You are an expert Japan travel planner...
- User interests: [temples, food]
- Travel style: moderate
- Days: 7

Generate a JSON response with:
{
  "days": [...],
  "tips": [...],
  "transportationTips": "...",
  "budgetSummary": "..."
}
```

## Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**: OpenAI has rate limits (adjust if needed)
2. **Cost**: Each generation costs money (though minimal)
3. **Latency**: Takes 5-10 seconds to generate
4. **Hallucinations**: AI may occasionally suggest non-existent places (rare)
5. **Internet Required**: Needs connection to OpenAI API

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Real-time chat** with AI travel assistant
2. **Activity photos** from AI-suggested places
3. **Weather integration** for day-specific recommendations
4. **Live pricing** for activities and restaurants
5. **Multi-language support** (Japanese, English, Spanish)
6. **Offline mode** with cached AI responses
7. **User feedback loop** to improve recommendations
8. **Integration with booking APIs** for hotels/restaurants

## Troubleshooting

### AI not generating activities

**Check:**
1. Console for errors
2. API key is valid
3. Internet connection is active
4. OpenAI API is not down

**Solution:** System will fallback to template-based generation

### AI Insights modal not showing

**Check:**
1. `window.AIIntegration` is defined
2. `ItineraryBuilder` is loaded
3. No JavaScript errors in console

**Solution:** Refresh page and try again

### "API Error" messages

**Possible causes:**
1. Invalid API key
2. Rate limit exceeded
3. Insufficient OpenAI credits
4. Network issues

**Solution:** 
- Verify API key
- Check OpenAI dashboard for credits
- Wait a few minutes and retry

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API key validity
3. Review this documentation
4. Check OpenAI API status
